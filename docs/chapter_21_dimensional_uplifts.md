# Chapter 21 – Dimensional Uplifts

## Description  
Constructs Kaluza–Klein embeddings of the d₃ coherence lattice into higher-dimensional manifolds, derives mode spectra, and examines compactification geometries.

## Key Equations
```math
ds² = g_{μν}(x)\,dx^μ dx^ν + R²\,dΩ_n²      # KK metric ansatz  
m_n² = m_0² + n²/R²                        # KK mass quantization

## Mathematical Findings
