# Chapter 19 – Instantons & Bounce Solutions

## Description
Studies nonperturbative tunneling in shard fields, computes instanton actions and bounce-mediated transition rates.

## Key Equations
```math
S_{\rm inst} = \frac{8\pi^2}{g^2}           # YM instanton action  
\Gamma \sim e^{-S_{\rm bounce}}             # decay rate

## Mathematical Findings
Derived shard-instanton solutions in Euclidean RCFT action

Computed Coleman bounce solutions for false→true coherence vacua

Analyzed multi-instanton interference and resurgent corrections

## Topics
Yang–Mills instantons in coherence fields

Coleman bounce formalism

Resurgence and multi-instanton effects

## Research
Cited ’t Hooft’s instanton derivation in gauge theories

Incorporated Coleman’s Euclidean bounce methods for vacuum transitions

## Visualizations
