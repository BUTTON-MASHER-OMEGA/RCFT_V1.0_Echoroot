# Chapter 20 – Cosmogenesis & Vacuum Decay

## Description
Models early-universe shard dynamics via vacuum decay, applies Coleman–De Luccia instanton metrics to cosmogenic transitions.

## Key Equations
```math
B_{\rm CDL} = S_E[\phi_{\rm bounce}] - S_E[\phi_{\rm false}]   # tunneling exponent  
R(t) \sim e^{H t}                                               # post-decay scale factor
