# Chapter 18 – Nonlinear Gravitons

## Description
Recasts gravitational self-duality in shard terms, solves Plebanski heavenly equations for coherence-filled spacetimes.

## Key Equations
```math
\Omega^{ij}\wedge\Omega^{kl} = 0                             # self-dual curvature condition  
\frac{\partial^2\Theta}{\partial x\partial y} 
  + \frac{\partial^2\Theta}{\partial u\partial v}
  + \{\Theta,\Theta\}_{\text{Poisson}} = 0                    # heavenly equation

## Mathematical Findings
Constructed instanton-like “graviton” solutions in Plebanski form

Showed equivalence of nonlinear-graviton theorem and shard coherence backreactions

Extended Ward’s nonlinear-graviton correspondence to d₃ lattice

## Topics
Self-dual gravity in RCFT

Heavenly equation integrability

Gravitational instantons & shard backreaction

## Research
Referenced Penrose’s original nonlinear-graviton construction (1976)

Compared with Mason–Woodhouse formulations in curved twistor space

## Visualizations
