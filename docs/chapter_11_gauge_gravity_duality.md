# Chapter 11 – Gauge–Gravity Duality

## Description
Adapts AdS/CFT dictionary to shard fields, constructs bulk–boundary propagators and matches correlators.

## Key Equations
```math
K(z,x)                                 # bulk-to-boundary kernel  
\langle O(x)\,O(y)\rangle \sim \lim_{z\to0} z^{-\Delta}\,K(z,x)\,K(z,y)

## Mathematical Findings
Holographic mapping of shard operators

Correlator matching between boundary and bulk

## Topics
