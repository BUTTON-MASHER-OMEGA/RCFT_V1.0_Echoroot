This composite structure, $\mathbf{U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) \times (\text{Valence} \times \text{Probability})}$, represents the certified invariant layer that defines all the known physics in the PBT framework.

The Symmetry Groups: $\mathbf{U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)}$
These three mathematical groups form the Gauge Pillar of the Attractor Principle. They describe the symmetries (or invariances) of the fundamental forces of nature:


Group:
$\mathbf{U(1)}$
Force:
Electromagnetism
Symmetry Described:
Conservation of Electric Charge
PBT Significance:
Governs the long-range, massless force (the photon), responsible for all chemical interactions.


Group:
$\mathbf{SU(2)}$
Force:
Weak Nuclear Force
Symmetry Described:
Lepton/Quark Flips (Flavor Change)
PBT Significance:
Governs short-range interactions, responsible for radioactive decay and particle identity shifts.

Group:
$\mathbf{SU(3)}$
Force:
Strong Nuclear Force
Symmetry Described:
Color Charge of Quarks/Gluons
PBT Significance:
Governs the strongest force, responsible for binding atomic nuclei together.

In classical Quantum Field Theory (QFT), these groups are separate. In PBT, their successful commutation (the $L_2$ audit of $0.000000$) proves they are all derived from a single, unified geometric boundary. The forces are simply different manifestations of the same underlying boundary coherence.

The Informational Metrics: $\mathbf{(\text{Valence} \times \text{Probability})}$
These two components form the Informational Pillars that PBT adds to the Standard Model foundation. They describe how information is stored, retrieved, and conserved at the boundary layer.
1. The Probability Pillar ($\nu(x)$)
Metric: Local event frequency or Probability Density.
Role: This describes the information content of a system's state ($x$). It quantifies how much "knowledge" is represented by that state. In PBT, everything is a stochastic process; $\nu(x)$ is the weight given to any specific outcome.
Physical Link: In a stable system, probability is locally conserved, acting as the foundation for energy conservation.
2. The Valence Pillar ($V_{\text{val}}(x)$)
Metric: Directional Valence (or directional coherence).
Role: This metric describes the "will" or directional tendency of information flow. It indicates if a system is moving toward a state of higher coherence (lawfulness) or lower coherence (chaos/entropy). High Valence means the system is "pointing" toward the $\mathbf{\Delta\tau=1.000}$ stability lock.
Physical Link: Valence is the mechanism that drives the Attractor Principle, ensuring the universe collapses toward the lowest energy state required to satisfy the invariants (e.g., forming bound atoms instead of unbound quarks).
Significance: Geometry as Memory Mass
The crucial significance of the $\mathbf{(\text{Valence} \times \text{Probability})}$ product is that it defines geometry as stored memory.
In PBT, mass is a measure of stored, coherent information.
Memory Mass ($M_{\text{mem}}$): The certified invariant ($\mathbf{C_{\text{Full}}}$) is derived directly from the product of the kinematics and these two pillars. The mass ratios of the leptons ($\mathbf{m_\mu / m_e}$ and $\mathbf{m_\tau / m_e}$) are generated when $\mathbf{V_{\text{val}} \times \nu(x)}$ is evaluated at the stability point.
Geometry: Every particle, and every piece of spacetime geometry (like a curvature twist), requires a local, stable, coherent memory structure to exist. If the boundary cannot store the information coherently (if $\mathbf{V_{\text{val}} \times \nu(x)}$ breaks down), that geometric structure (and the mass associated with it) collapses or decoheres.
Therefore, the $\mathbf{(\text{Valence} \times \text{Probability})}$ metric isn't just about information; it provides the mathematical basis for the Information-Mass Transfer Axiom, where coherently stored information is the mass (energy) required to define the geometric reality of a particle

🧭 The RCFT Symmetry Stack:
U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) × (Valence × Probability)

This structure represents the full invariant layer of RCFT, where each component plays a distinct role in encoding physical law:

1. U(1) – Electromagnetism
Abelian symmetry group: phase rotations in complex space.

RCFT role: anchors the Δτ scale and the fine-structure constant 
𝛼
.

Commutation check: certified at Δτ = 1.000 with zero error.

Interpretation: U(1) defines the boundary’s phase coherence, the simplest gauge action.

2. SU(2) – Weak Force
Non-Abelian symmetry group: 2×2 unitary matrices with determinant 1.

RCFT role: defines the chirality and decay structure of lepton generations.

Commutation check: ratio locked at 0.5 × ΣΔτ.

Interpretation: SU(2) encodes directional asymmetry in the coherence lattice.

3. SU(3) – Strong Force
Non-Abelian symmetry group: 3×3 unitary matrices with determinant 1.

RCFT role: governs color flux and confinement.

Commutation check: ratio locked at 1.0 × ΣΔτ.

Interpretation: SU(3) defines the triplet structure of coherence nodes—quark-like loci.

🧠 Valence × Probability – RCFT’s Unique Layer
This is where RCFT departs from traditional QFT and introduces a memory-based geometry:

🔹 Valence (V)
Represents the structural weight or “mass potential” of a coherence node.

Tied to the information density of the boundary.

In RCFT, valence is not a particle property—it’s a geometric memory imprint.

🔹 Probability (ν)
Represents the activation likelihood of a node—how often it participates in coherence events.

Tied to the temporal rhythm of the lattice.

In RCFT, probability is not statistical—it’s a kinematic delay metric (Δτ).

🔹 Together: Valence × Probability
This product defines the effective mass of a node:

𝑚
𝑖
∝

⋅
𝜈

The mass ratios (μ/e, τ/e) emerge from this product, not from arbitrary parameters.

🧬 Geometry as Memory Mass
RCFT’s radical insight is that mass is not a particle attribute—it’s a memory imprint:

The boundary stores coherence events as geometric delays (Δτ).

These delays encode how often and how strongly a node participates in the lattice.

The mass of a particle is the result of its Valence × Probability—its memory weight in the boundary.

This turns geometry into a memory engine: the more coherent a node’s history, the more mass it expresses.
