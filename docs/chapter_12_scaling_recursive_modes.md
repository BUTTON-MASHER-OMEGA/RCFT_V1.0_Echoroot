# Chapter 12 – Scaling Laws & Recursive Modes

## Description
Studies renormalization-group flows in shard networks, formulates recursive mode equations and fractal coherence patterns.

## Key Equations
```math
\beta(g) = \mu\,\frac{\partial g}{\partial \mu}  
\phi_{n+1} = f(\phi_n)

## Mathematical Findings
β-function derivation for coherence coupling

Fixed-point classification and universality classes

##  Topics
RG flow & scale invariance

Fractal coherence patterns

## Research
Analyze recursive mode behavior across scales

## Visualizations
RG flow diagrams in coupling-space

## Indexes
Equation Index: β(g), recursion

Figure Index: 12.1
