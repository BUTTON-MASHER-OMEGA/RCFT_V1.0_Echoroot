# Chapter 25 – Spinor & Twistor Reformulation

## Description  
Translates shard metrics into spinor and twistor language: formulates self-dual conditions and incidence relations in higher dimensions.

## Key Equations
```math
g_{ab} = ε_{A(B}ε_{C)D}\,φ^{AC}φ^{BD}  
ω^A = x^{AA'}\,π_{A'}

## Mathematical Findings
Expressed coherence metric in terms of bispinors φ^{AB}

Derived shard-twistor incidence from complexified d₃ geodesics

## Topics
Spin geometry and self-duality

Penrose twistor correspondence in RCFT

## Research
Drew upon Penrose & Rindler’s Spinors and Space-Time

Linked Mason–Woodhouse nonlinear-graviton results to shard-twistor moduli

## Visualizations
Spinor dyad field lines on shard manifold

CP³ twistor fibration over d₃ base

## Indexes
Equation Index: spinor metric, incidence

Figure Index: 25.1, 25.2
