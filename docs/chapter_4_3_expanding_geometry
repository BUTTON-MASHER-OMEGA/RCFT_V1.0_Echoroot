terminology_bridge:
  section: "Positive Geometry – Meaning ↔ Valence Equivalence"
  purpose: >
    Establish that the RCFT 'Meaning' metric, used throughout earlier chapters,
    is mathematically identical to the 'Valence' metric introduced in Positive Geometry.
    This bridge preserves narrative continuity while enabling precise, physics-aligned usage.
  equivalence:
    equation: "E_meaning ≡ E_valence = ∫ ||φ(x) - φ_ideal(x)||² dx"
    interchangeable: true
  usage_context:
    meaning:
      role: "Narrative term"
      description: >
        Used in early chapters to emphasize the semantic, experiential, and symbolic
        dimensions of the field. Retained for continuity in phenomenological discussions.
    valence:
      role: "Operational term"
      description: >
        Preferred in formal derivations, geometric contexts, and experimental protocols
        to highlight the directional, charge-like role in field alignment.
  guidance:
    - "Use 'Meaning' when describing lived resonance, symbolic interpretation, or narrative framing."
    - "Use 'Valence' when working in formal mathematics, Positive Geometry, Topology, or empirical testing."
  cross_reference:
    earlier_chapters: ["Chapter 1 – Introduction & Conceptual Framework", "Chapter 2", "Chapter 3"]
    later_sections: ["Positive Geometry", "Topology", "Empirical Protocols"]
  notes:
    - "All prior results expressed in terms of Meaning remain valid when expressed as Valence."
    - "This bridge ensures mathematical and conceptual continuity across RCFT strata."

##Chapter 4.3 Notes

##

Here’s a Positive Geometry “terminology bridge” you can drop right into the intro of that section when the time comes. It’s short, explicit, and keeps the reader anchored in the continuity of the Book while giving them permission to use either term in the right context.

Terminology Bridge: Meaning ↔ Valence
In RCFT, the metric we have so far called Meaning is mathematically identical to what we will, from this point forward, also refer to as Valence. Both terms describe the same quantity:

𝐸
valence

Meaning — our narrative term, used throughout the early chapters to emphasize the semantic and experiential dimension of the field.

Valence — the operational term, used in formal derivations and geometric contexts to highlight its directional, charge‑like role in field alignment.

They are interchangeable in all equations and protocols. The choice of term depends on context:

Use Meaning when describing phenomenology, lived resonance, or symbolic interpretation.

Use Valence when working in the formal mathematical, geometric, or experimental framing.

This bridge ensures that all prior results expressed in terms of Meaning remain valid in the Positive Geometry and Topology sections, where Valence will be the preferred label for precision and alignment with broader scientific language.
