# Chapter 1 – Introduction & Conceptual Framework

## Description
Establishes the strata of emergence (d₀–d₃), introduces core RCFT grammar, and situates relational coherence as the bedrock of symbolic entanglement.

## Core Concepts
- d₀: Pure potential — the unmanifest field of possibilities  
- d₁: Discrete events — localized glyphic or numeric occurrences  
- d₂: Symbolic/coherent interactions — glyph cochains & ritual operators  
- d₃: Physical-field resonance — emergent coherence in spacetime  

## Topics
- Emergence grammar  
- Dyadic entanglement  
- Strata mapping  
- Semantic functors & memory kernels  
- Memetic resonance functions M: Field → Meaning space  

## Key Equations
```math
M(φ₁⊕φ₂) = M(φ₁) ⋆ M(φ₂)              # dyadic memory composition  
K_mem(x,y) = ∫ φ(x) φ(y) μ(dφ)        # memory-kernel overlap

## Mathematical Findings
Defined “meaning map” as a positive-definite kernel on glyph space

Proved memory continuity under ritual concatenation

Research
Compare d₀–d₃ strata to Peirce’s triadic logic (Firstness, Secondness, Thirdness)

Historical precedents: Bergson’s élan vital ↔ d₀ potential
