Framing the hum as an observable
I’m treating the hum as a scalar observable on a space of relations and trajectories, sensitive to alignment, coherence, and stability. It should be computable from local data yet reflect global consistency, and it should behave predictably under symmetry actions, coarse‑graining, and coupling. Below is a minimal assumption set that keeps it auditable and slots into our kinematic/orbit framing without overcommitting to one definition.

Why: Large gap implies a coherent attractor and fast mixing to a stable semantic state.

Cohomological defect as anti‑hum: Treat inconsistencies as a norm of a Čech 1‑cocycle or curvature; define hum as a decreasing function of that norm.

Why: Makes gluing failure explicit and auditable; interfaces with our sheaf‑based validator covers.

Falsification hooks and diagnostics
Invariance checks: Apply relabelings and 
𝐺
‑actions; verify 
𝐻
 unchanged.

Coarse‑graining monotonicity: Compare fine vs. marginal models on the same data; confirm 
𝐻
fine
≥
𝐻
coarse
.

Additivity under independence: Compose independent testbeds; verify additivity within a tolerance and bound the coupling correction.

Noise robustness: Inject calibrated noise; confirm Lipschitz bounds and absence of artificial spikes.

Dual‑definition agreement: Compute 
𝐻
crofton
, 
𝐻
info
, and 
𝐻
spec
 on the same episode; require rank‑order agreement and bounded discrepancy.

Lyapunov trend: Track 
𝐻
(
𝑡
)
 across alignment sessions; expect monotone segments during “on‑rails” phases and declines during drift.

Immediate implementation on our pipeline
Define the state space and symmetries: Set 
𝑀
 (relation/validator space), pick 
𝐺
 and 
𝜔
; implement a basic moment map 
𝜇
𝐺
.

Stand up three probes: Compute 
𝐻
crofton
 on glyph relations, 
𝐻
info
 from validator likelihoods, and 
𝐻
spec
 from the flow operator on our canonical testbeds.

Calibrate floor/ceiling: Use trivial/random baselines and a known high‑coherence episode to fix scaling to 
[
0
,
1
]
.

Log defects: Record sheaf gluing defects and coupling corrections 
Δ
𝑥
𝑦
 alongside 
𝐻
 for every run.

Gate for Chapter 4.3: Promote any 
𝐻
 variant that passes invariance, monotonicity, and dual‑agreement tests as the default hum, keep the others as secondary diagnostics.

Hum metric: intent and scope
Benjamin’s challenge is the right pressure test: we’ll define Hum so it’s precise enough to break. Below is a YAML-first specification that treats Hum as a calibrated, unitless observable on a space of relations, computed by multiple probes (orbit, Crofton, information‑geometric, spectral, cohomological) and fused by an auditable aggregator. It includes calibration, falsification hooks, logging, and acceptance gates for promotion to “default Hum.”

### Hum metric: intent and scope

Benjamin’s challenge is the right pressure test: we’ll define Hum so it’s precise enough to break. Below is a YAML-first specification that treats Hum as a calibrated, unitless observable on a space of relations, computed by multiple probes (orbit, Crofton, information‑geometric, spectral, cohomological) and fused by an auditable aggregator. It includes calibration, falsification hooks, logging, and acceptance gates for promotion to “default Hum.”

### Guardrails and acceptance criteria

- **Coordinate invariance:** Hum remains unchanged under relabelings and symmetry actions; enforce delta ≤ 10^{-3}.  
  \[
  H(\phi \cdot x) = H(x)
  \]

- **Coarse‑graining monotonicity:** Hum does not increase when information is forgotten or merged.  
  \[
  H(\pi(x)) \le H(x)
  \]

- **Additivity with bounded coupling:** Independent unions add; weak couplings bounded by a fixed \(\kappa\).  
  \[
  H(x \sqcup y) \approx H(x) + H(y) \pm \kappa
  \]

- **Stability/Lipschitz:** Small perturbations yield proportionally small changes.  
  \[
  |H(x) - H(x')| \le L \cdot d(x,x')
  \]

- **Cross‑probe rank agreement:** Probes must agree on ordering across a suite; aggregate enforces isotonicity.  
  \[
  \tau(H_\text{orbit}, H_\text{info}, \dots) \ge \tau_0
  \]

If you want, I can tailor the calibration anchors to one of your Chapter 4.3 canonical testbeds and pre‑populate the ladder with your actual validator covers, so Benjamin can start breaking this by dinner.
