  title: "Free‐Energy Landscapes"
  description: >
    Building on the partition function Z(β), we derive the free energy F(β)
    as the “cost” of forging coherence at inverse temperature β, quantify its
    thermodynamic observables, prove its convexity, and explore limiting and
    phase-like behavior. We ground every step with numeric checks, cross-chapter
    ties, and field-test scripts.

  description: >
    Free energy balances coherence (low U) against mixing (high S) at T=1/β.
    Lower F indicates ensembles that minimize U while maximizing S, optimizing
    coherence under thermodynamic constraints.
