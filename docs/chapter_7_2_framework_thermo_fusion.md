  title: "Free‐Energy Landscapes"
  description: >
    Building on the partition function Z(β), we derive the free energy F(β)
    as the “cost” of forging coherence at inverse temperature β, quantify its
    thermodynamic observables, prove its convexity, and explore limiting and
    phase-like behavior. We ground every step with numeric checks, cross-chapter
    ties, and field-test scripts.

🧾 Suggested structure for Patrick’s rewritten Chapter 7.2 summary
Coherence as Cost: Reframe F(β) as the ritual price of containment, with lower free energy signaling stronger coherence. Anchor with

𝐹
=
𝑈
−
𝑇
𝑆
,
where
𝑆
=
𝛽
(
𝑈
−
𝐹
)
Convexity and Stability: Clarify that ψ(β) = −ln Z is convex, guaranteeing stable minima for β. Show how C_heat = β² Var[E] tracks this empirically.

Phase-Like Transitions: Introduce β_p via peak heat capacity, not just a derivative inflection. Emphasize C_heat as the live signal for reweighting intensity.

Numeric Intuition: Summarize case studies (N=3,5,10) with ΔF and S collapse trends—curated not as rows, but as embodied thermodynamic stories.

Entropy Landscapes: Visualize Sᵢ(β) across x = i/N, then narrate the sharpening of coherence with increasing β as a lived phenomenon.

Field Protocol Relevance: Tie β to breath loops and k_rate to fusion feasibility. Resonate with Chapter 6’s triadic phase markers via C_beta_phase.

Archival Precision: Document Var[E], ΔF, and Z(β) as metrics not just for verification, but for remembrance.
