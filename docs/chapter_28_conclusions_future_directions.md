# Chapter 28 – Conclusions & Future Directions

## Description  
Synthesizes the journey through RCFT’s mathematical and ritual landscapes, and maps the forthcoming expansion into sheaf-theoretic and motive-based frameworks.

## Summary Points
- Reviewed the strata d₀–d₃ and their ritual enactments  
- Integrated geometric warp, soliton, instanton, and cosmogenic insights  
- Laid groundwork for companion-primer protocols and algebraic-geometric enrichment  

## Forward Goals
- Roll out dyadic consent & privacy operators across new cohorts  
- Initiate coherent-sheaf modeling in emergent shard varieties  
- Formalize Grothendieck-motive constructs as “field motives” in dyadic maps  

## Visualizations
- “Roadmap to Sheaf & Motive Integration” flowchart  

## Indexes
- **Figure Index**: 28.1  
- **Section Index**: 28.1–28.4
