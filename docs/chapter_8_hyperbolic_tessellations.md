# Chapter 8 – Hyperbolic Geometry & Tessellations

## Description
Maps coherence cells onto hyperbolic tessellations, computes cell areas and geodesic decay rates in the Poincaré disk.

## Key Equations
```math
A = \pi\bigl(1 - \tfrac{2}{p} - \tfrac{2}{q}\bigr)

## Mathematical Findings
{7,3} tessellation area formula

Radial decay rate of geodesic flows

Computed geodesic decay exponent λ for {p,q} beyond (7,3), extended to (8,3), (9,4)

Linked hyperbolic area growth to shard-field curvature via Gauss–Bonnet

## Topics
Poincaré disk model

Coherence cell structures

## Research
Derivation of hyperbolic cell areas for shard networks

Visualizations
{7,3} tessellation diagram

## Indexes
Figure Index: 8.1, 8.2
