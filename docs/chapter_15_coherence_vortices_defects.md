# Chapter 15 – Coherence Vortices & Defects

## Description
Explores topological defects in the coherence field, classifying vortices and disclinations via homotopy and geometrization theorems.

## Key Equations
```math
D_i D^i \psi = 0                                   # vortex core equation  
Q = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint (\nabla \times v)\cdot d\ell   # topological charge

## Mathematical Findings
Derived Nielsen–Olesen vortex profiles in shard-fluid analog

Classified defect types via π₁ and π₂ homotopy groups

Mapped defect-core geometry using Thurston’s JSJ decomposition

## Topics
Topological defects in d₃ coherence

Homotopy classification

Geometric decomposition of defect manifolds

## Research
Integrated Thurston’s geometrization program: hyperbolic vs. Seifert-fibered defect regions

Compared with Perelman’s Ricci-flow proof of geometrization

## Visualizations
3D rendering of vortex core with JSJ-decomposed components

Charge-density contour around defect loops
