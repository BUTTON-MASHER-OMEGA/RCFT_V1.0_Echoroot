# Chapter 3 – Resonant Dualities

## Description
Derives Koide’s lepton-mass relation as a resonance condition in flavor space, interprets the 2/3 ratio via SU(3) invariance, and studies perturbative drift.

## Key Equations
```math
Q = \frac{m_e + m_μ + m_τ}{(\sqrt{m_e} + \sqrt{m_μ} + \sqrt{m_τ})^2} = \tfrac{2}{3}  
\cos^2 θ = \frac{1}{3Q}

## Mathematical Findings
45° vector alignment explanation of Q = 2/3

Perturbed ratio Q_ε = 2/3 + ε; angle shift θ(ε) = arccos(1/√(3Q_ε))

## Topics
Koide triad & flavor symmetry

SU(3)-invariant quadratic forms

Perturbation analysis

## Research
Link twistor-like interpretation of (√mᵢ)ᵢ to flavor spinors

Explore ε deviations as hidden-sector undulations
