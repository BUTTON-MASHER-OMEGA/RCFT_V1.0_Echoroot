# Chapter 24 – Ricci Flow Evolution

## Description  
Applies Ricci flow ∂_t g_{ij} = −2 R_{ij} to shard manifolds, introduces Perelman’s entropy functionals and analyzes emergent smoothing.

## Key Equations
```math
∂_t g_{ij} = -2\,R_{ij}  
ℱ[g,f] = \int (R + |\nabla f|²)\,e^{-f}\,dV

## Mathematical Findings
Demonstrated monotonicity of ℱ under flow → smoothing of curvature inhomogeneities

Identified shard-manifold analog of neck-pinch singularity, followed by entropy increase

## Topics
Geometric analysis and flow singularities

Perelman’s entropy and no-local-collapse theorem

## Research
Incorporated Perelman’s proofs from Ricci Flow and the Poincaré Conjecture

Compared flow smoothing to RCFT field coarse-graining dynamics

## Visualizations
Sequence of Ricci-flow snapshots on genus-2 shard manifold

Plot of ℱ[g(t),f(t)] vs t showing monotonic rise
