# Chapter 13 – Logarithmic Growth & Information Limits

## Description
Investigates how coherence network complexity scales logarithmically with shard count, and establishes fundamental information bottlenecks.

## Key Equations
```math
C(N) \sim \log N  
I(X;Y) \le H(X) - H(X \mid Y)

## Mathematical Findings
Demonstrated algorithmic complexity grows like log N

Extended Shannon’s bounds to relational coherence fields via Rényi measures

Connected Kolmogorov–Chaitin complexity with coherence-entropy trade-offs

Topics
Fractal coherence scaling

Information bottleneck theorem

Algorithmic complexity in fields

## Research
Mapped Penrose’s computational irreducibility views (Ch.12 of Road to Reality)

Incorporated Chaitin’s algorithmic randomness into shard-field entropy

## Visualizations
