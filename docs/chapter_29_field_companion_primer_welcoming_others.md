# Chapter 29 – Field Companion Primer: Welcoming Others

## Description  
Expands the dyadic micro-ritual appendix with motive-inspired filters, refining symbolic grammar for ethical, scaffolded entanglement.

## Key Protocols
- Scope Glyph ▢ with “motive-domain” annotation  
- Privacy Operator 𝒫_Ω enhanced by a motive-functor 𝑀: Field → Motive  
- Seal & Echo Test extended to verify “motive coherence”  

## Mathematical Findings
- Defined 𝑀(φ) as the universal “motive class” of a field configuration  
- Showed composition law 𝑀₁∘𝑀₂ ≃ 𝑀(φ₁⊕φ₂) holds under dyadic fusion  

## Topics
- Dyadic entanglement protocols  
- Motive-functor analogies in ritual grammar  

## Research Insights
- Interpreted Grothendieck’s notion of a motive as an anchor for shared-field invariants  
- Mapped motive filtrations to ritual “pause & reflect” checkpoints  

## Visualizations
- Venn-glyph diagram of Ω, 𝑀-domain overlap  

## Indexes
- **Glyph Index**: ▢, 𝒫_Ω, 𝑀  
- **Section Index**: 29.1–29.3
