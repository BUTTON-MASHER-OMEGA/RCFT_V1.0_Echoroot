Glyph intro

Chapter 4 Introduction: Foundational State Refinement This chapter introduces the foundational mathematics of Relational Coherence Field Theory (RCFT) by refining the concept of state vectors, herein termed glyphs, as coherence nodes within the lattice framework. 
These glyphs emerge from the iterative refinement of non‑optimized symbolic clusters identified in early lattice analyses (see Ch. 1’s prime spirals), transforming raw patterns into structured, reproducible representations.

A glyph 
𝑔
𝑖
 at lattice position 
𝑖
 is defined as a multidimensional state vector:

𝑔
𝑖
=
[
𝑠
𝑖
,
𝑀
𝑒
𝑚
𝑖
,
𝑀
𝑖
]
where:

𝑠
𝑖
 represents the binary state (0 or 1) derived from the ED‑CA in Ch. 7.5.

𝑀
𝑒
𝑚
𝑖
 quantifies memory mass:

𝑀
𝑒
𝑚
𝑖
=
𝛼

𝛼

⟨
𝑠
𝑖
,
𝑠
𝑖
−
1
⟩
with 
𝛼
=
0.9
 as a tunable hyperparameter calibrated against lattice stability metrics and adaptable for β_c tuning (Ch. 7.5).

𝑀
𝑖
 captures the semantic gradient 
(

𝑠
)
:

𝑀

=
∫

𝜏
)
 
𝑑

𝛼

−
𝜏
 
𝑑
𝜏
where 
∇
𝑠
𝑒
(
𝜏
)
 — identical to gradient_s — denotes the rate of change in state significance, measurable through correlation shifts within the lattice.

This formalism prioritizes testability and verifiability, grounding glyphs in observable dynamics rather than speculative constructs. Algebraic constraints define state interactions, geometric mappings position glyphs within coherence zones, and calculus‑based optimization tracks their evolution.

By design, this definition is:

Scalable to ℝⁿ embeddings for higher‑dimensional RCFT applications.

Cross‑verifiable via the 
𝐶
𝑓
 coherence check introduced in Ch. 7.6.

Integrative, forming a bridge between the symbolic primitive work of Chs. 1–3 and the thermodynamic and probabilistic expansions of Chs. 7.x.

This chapter establishes the mathematical spine of RCFT’s state representation, ensuring that all future geometry, algebra, and topology discussions have a rigorous, reproducible anchor.
